# Installation

When pressing Hitfel 5 on a stock (stock as in not touched or modified at all) system, you will be met with two options, **Start Normally** or **Start Setup**, if you haven't installed the system at all, you should press Start Setup. If you press, Start Normally without the system being installed the features may not work properly at all.

When you press Start Setup, it will begin installing with a slideshow of all the features available. **An internet connection is required.**

After the installation is finished, you will be asked to press the green flag and restart the system. The system will be fully installed and yours to use!
