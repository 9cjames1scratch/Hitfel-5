# Modifying the system

The Hitfel 5 is really simple to edit and modify to your liking. You will need basic knowledge on block based programming. This system was made and compiled for Scratch in [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org). It is recommended to use that to edit your system.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">When your system becomes modified or touched in anyway, even if its small your system is no longer a stock system and support will no longer be provided for your device. Please edit at your own risk.</mark>
{% endhint %}

## Changing the boot sequence

Changing the boot sequence is not recommended at all. Unless you're changing the splash screen, you probably shouldn't touch the boot options unless you know what you're doing.

## Creating custom apps

Similar to the stock (stock as in not touched or modified at all) system, you should just follow along and duplicate parts of their apps to make your own apps or you can shortcut apps from +app.

## Debugging the system or looking for bugs

Please visit [booting-shortcuts.md](booting/booting-shortcuts.md "mention") page for more information.

## Other stuff

Other things should be handled with care. The system itself should be handled with care, messing with the wrong thing can break the entire system. (Of course, [Failsafe](failsafe.md) will usually be there to save the day.)
