# Wi-Fi Module

The Hitfel 5 is equipped with a simple Wi-Fi system that automatically detects if your host system is connected to the internet.

The Wi-Fi module is also required to boot the system. If one of the parts of the module is missing, then the system will fail to boot.

The Wi-Fi module does not need access to cloud services like [OnTags](home-menu/ontags.md) does. If the host system does not have a connection then the module will alert [ProID Exchange](home-menu/proid-exchange-hitfel-5.md) and prevent apps that require an internet connection from opening.
