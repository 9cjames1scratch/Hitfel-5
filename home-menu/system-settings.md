# System Settings

On Version 3.0, you can now access the System Settings. This replaces some of [Aurora](aurora.md)'s feature, however for the time being you can still change a few system settings with Aurora.

## System

In the System group of options, you can enable the Loaded app which prevents or allows you to access the app that is loaded into the console. You also can turn on or off [Mobile Mode](system-settings.md#mobile-mode). You also  can check what version you're on.

### Mobile Mode

Mobile Mode is a work-in-progress feature that allows you to change certain aspects of the console to reflect mobile devices. Right now, you get access to a draggable home button.

## Internet

Similar to the [ProID Exchange](proid-exchange-hitfel-5.md) Quick Icon, you can check the status of the Internet or disable it.

## Other

You can Factory Reset the system which will delete all data. You can also change [Passcode Security](../passcode-security.md) settings, and deplete all [HitCoins](proid-exchange-hitfel-5.md) from your balance.
