# +app

\+app is an online app store system for the Hitfel 5 device which allows you to download and install preselected apps.

Using [ProID Exchange](proid-exchange-hitfel-5.md), +app gets app data and allows you to purchase and sync your [HitCoins](+app.md#hitcoins) to purchase apps.

## HitCoins

HitCoins is the name of the virtual currency that the Hitfel 3 (now defunct) and Hitfel 5 uses. HitCoins are nonrefundable and cannot be purchased, so once you spend your HitCoins they are gone forever. HitCoins can be earned three ways. One HitCoin is produced and added to your balance, every thirty seconds. Ten HitCoins are produced every hour. And ten HitCoins will be given if you get an OnTag.
