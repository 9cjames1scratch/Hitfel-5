# OnTags

On the Nintendo 3DS family of systems, you will find a local wireless service called Streetpass. Similar to Streetpass, the Hitfel 5 uses OnTags.

OnTag is an internet connection service that gives rewards for scanning and connecting with other users.

By default, an OnTag scan will produce ten [HitCoins](+app.md#hitcoins) to use in +app. Supported apps such as the upcoming OnTag Claw game will allow you to earn prizes and rewards depending on how many times you've got an OnTag at the current session.
