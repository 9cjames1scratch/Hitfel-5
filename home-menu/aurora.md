# Aurora

Similar to the ring assistant in the Hitfel 3 device, Aurora is the virtual assistant for the Hitfel 5 device.

Aurora handles most of the settings such as checking the console ID or factory resetting the console. Aurora is a voice virtual assistant using text to speech and to properly hear the commands, you must turn up your volume.

**Some commands require the use of the Internet.**
