When you press the A button, you will be taken to the Home Menu. There are quite a few buttons you can press which will all have different options.

## Time

On the top left corner, you will see a 24 hour/Military Time clock which shows per hour, minute, and seconds. The same would also appear in the Quick Menu.

## Aurora

Aurora can be used by the quick icons on the left side. Aurora has many commands and only uses voice (as in she does not have any text and you will need to turn up the volume to listen to the commands.)
