# ProID Exchange (Hitfel 5)

ProID Exchange is the online networking system for the Hitfel and ProID OS devices.

In the Hitfel 5, ProID Exchange is used to make online transfers such as OnTags or connect users to the internet. ProID Exchange settings are handled with the ProID Exchange icon in the Quick Icons.

ProID Exchange has the ability to check if the host device is connected to the internet. If ProID Exchange detects that a connection isn't established, then online features such as +app will be unavailable.
