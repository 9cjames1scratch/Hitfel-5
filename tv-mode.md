# TV Mode

TV Mode is a saturation fix for TV's that changes the colors of the screen to see better on a TV Screen.

If you decide, you want to display your Hitfel 5's screen onto a TV, you can use aN HDMI Cable (if your device supports it), Cast (Chromecast), or AirPlay (Screen Mirroring). This will allow your device to be shown on a TV Screen.

Next, on the Home Menu, below the Battery Icon, you should see a TV Icon. Pressing on it will ask you to toggle TV Mode, when its on it will default to its first option. Pressing it again will allow you to disable it or change the settings for it. Each level has a different flavor of how dark or light your TV Screen display is, and you get to choose.
