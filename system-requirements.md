# System Requirements

The Hitfel 5 does not require much and is relatively small. You will need a host system that has [access to cloud servers to use OnTags](system-requirements.md#ontags), such as the [official Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/855386440/). You can download Hitfel 5 versions from [here](https://github.com/ProID-Corporation/Hitfel-5).

## Networking

OnTag and +app require the use of ProID Exchange which needs an internet connection.

### +app

You must be connected to the internet to open and read data on +app however, you can disconnect once you've launched an app, however an internet connection will be required to open +app and read data again.

### OnTags

OnTags requires the use of the internet at all times, especially while scanning, OnTags also requires access to a cloud server to get reach other users.

## Performance

We recommend at least 2 GB of memory to get smooth animations. If that isn't possible, 1 GB may work as well.

## Space

If used in the browser, it depends on the size of the cookies. Otherwise, you will need at least 13 MB of free space or more depending on updates.
