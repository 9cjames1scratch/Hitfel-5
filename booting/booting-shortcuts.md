# Booting Shortcuts

The Hitfel 5 stock (stock as in not touched or modified at all) system includes a few debug shortcuts that are only enabled for certain users.

## Failsafe Force

Failsafe has a boot shortcut when pressing **Space + H** keys which allows you to produce any of the three errors or RSOD's available. This is dangerous however and can cause for data loss. Use with testing purposes only.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is dangerous as Hardware and Fatal errors require the use of the factory reset button.
{% endhint %}

## Install Value Change

If you press the **I** key at any time, it will change the install value. It is recommended to just use the provided install utility as this only changes the install value.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">THIS WILL ONLY CHANGE THE INSTALL VALUE, OTHER FILES MAY BE MISSING, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</mark>
{% endhint %}

## [HitCoins](../home-menu/+app.md#hitcoins) Value Change

For debug purposes only, you can add an amount of HitCoins you want. Pressing the **Up Arrow + Down Arrow** on boot, you can add HitCoins to your current balance.
